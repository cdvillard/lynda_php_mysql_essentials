# Tutorial Sandbox: Lynda's "PHP with MySQL Essential Training"

This is my sandbox repo for Lynda.com's "PHP with MySQL Essential Training" course. I'm currently on Chapter 5, "Exploring Data Types". Taught by Kevin Skoglund.

**Why are you publishing these repos?**
I got into web development because there's always something to learn, and I'm always learning something new. But, with immense curiousity comes a fair amount of ADD, and I tend to jump around a bit playing with whatever I feel like that day. This is how I keep a tab on what part of the tutorial I'm at, and it gives me a place to pull my work from whether I be working through the Cloud9 IDE or directly on my personal machine.

**Wouldn't publishing your work in these repos promote cheating?**
No, it wouldn't be, because these are not answers to a test, quiz, or challenge. These repos are of work completed up to a certain point. In fact, it would allow other fledgling developers a chance to see how their work stacks up to others, and check for stylistic differences in whitespace or tabbing. This is my opinion, of course, and if told otherwise by the author(s) of a specific course, I'll gladly take down the repo.
